- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sof-AI and I code primarily in Python 
- 👀 I’m interested in backend development, ML/AI, data science, and game development!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about circuit boards, systems architecture, and large-scale web scraping!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-level open source projects to grind my coding skills and learn more about the tech community.
